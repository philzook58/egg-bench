# egg-bench

PLEASE SUBMIT MORE BENCHMARKS!!!

![](./egg_bench.jpg)

The e-graph community needs benchmarks in a portable format to compare systems and techniques.

For my purposes I have found SMTLIB the be very useful. SMTLIB can be imported and manipulated by Z3 in your language of choice.
egglog is also rising in popularity.

This repo has tools to translate between them (and any other formats which may be useful) and sets of problems.

We need both theorem proving and optimization benchmarks.

It would be cool to get this together enough to start holding egg-comp.
